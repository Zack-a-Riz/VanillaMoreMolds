Do you want more diverse molds while staying true to the spirit and mechanics of the game? This mod is for you!
Dev Update : Almost 4000 downloads soon!

The update for the large molds is taking me a bit more time than expected. There are a lot of changes, and I‚Äôm implementing a new crafting mechanic for this type of mold in a vanilla-friendly style. However, I don‚Äôt want to rush my work, so I‚Äôm taking the necessary time to ensure everything is well-polished. I hope that once the update is released, it will meet your expectations and be something you‚Äôll enjoy !
When I have a stable snapshot version, it will be available in the snapshot branch on my GitHub for testing and feedback.
Thank you so much for the (almost) 4000 downloads ‚Äì it truly warms my heart! üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è




Indeed, the Vanilla More Molds project aims to add new varieties of molds to expand the arsenal of your forge, all while staying true to the base game (mechanics, smelting logic, crafting).

The mod also seeks to give Fire Clay additional value by allowing the creation of advanced ingot molds for mass production

FAQ :

Will you add new tool molds?

- In theory, I could, but adding extra tool molds would break the use of the forge, so it's not planned. However, adding more utilitarian molds, like large ingot molds for example, is planned!

Can I translate the mod into another language?

- The mod is currently available in English, Chinese, Russian and French, but if you have any other suggestions, I‚Äôd be happy to hear them. You can submit your translations via GitHub ( link in the 'Source' tab ).

Is there a config file?

- No, not yet. And if there ever is one, it would be for features that wouldn‚Äôt break the vanilla aspect of the game.

I can't manage to pour molten copper into the hoop mold!

- It's normal, copper hoops don't exist in the game :)

...

Future plan :
Reinforced mold (protect from bad weather)
Color mold compared to the clay used
Special storage rack for ingot molds
More uses of fireclay
Compatibility with others mods
Keep the mod up to date :3

I‚Äôm open to suggestions, as long as they stay within the theme of the mod.
